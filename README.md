3 --> installation

1.Software used
Pycharm community edition(2024.3)
Vs code editor
both uses the interpretor
python(3.10.0)

2.python libraries such as
first install pip in interpretor then install below libraries using vscode terminal or cmd
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pickle
pip install json
pip install flask

3.open the folder in vs code to edit the files or to change ip in js file

4.open the folder in pycharm and run the server.py file to get the ip of server

these are the things what i personally used you can even use other software but i think these are begineer friendly

4 --> Deployment of project

You can do it many ways
1.click on project folder html code -> open in crome
2.Vs code live server extension  download -> go live(bottom right corner)

5 --> error tackle

1.Be clear while naming the file and folder because they are case sensitive
2.functions name are also case sensitive
3.use the same software so that there is less chance of errors
